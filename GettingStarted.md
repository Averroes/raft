# Getting Started #

Here is information on getting started with RAFT.

  * [Installation](Installation.md) - Information about getting RAFT installed
  * [Analysis](Analysis.md) - Information about analyzers in RAFT

## Adding Payloads ##
You can add your own custom payloads to RAFT allowing them to be selectable in the payload mapping section of the fuzzer as well as the data bank (future). Simply take your payload files and drop them in the data/payloads directory. These items will then be available for you.

**Note** Payload files must be formatted with one item per line. This is the only format supported at this time. This is a fairly common formatting and many projects adopt this style of formatting anyway.
